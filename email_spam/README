# this is a test for email spam classifier    
just a simple test, and I hope to learn the machine learning process by this
simple example   

The data is pulled from
http://csmining.org/index.php/spam-email-datasets-.html      
First, the extract process:   
just extract by words, and stop words or html labels,   
other techniques may be used, such as dom parser for html.
