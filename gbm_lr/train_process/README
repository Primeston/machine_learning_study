# first, train by the xgboost:    
# ../../ is the xgboost dir    
../../xgboost add.conf    
../../xgboost ad.conf task=dump model_in=0008.model name_dump=dump.raw.txt    
    
# next, get the xgboost leaves, that is the input of the LR model    
cat input.train | python get_gbooster_out.py > lr.train    
cat input.test | python get_gbooster_out.py > lr.test    
    
# then, train the LR model    
# ./ is the liblinear dir
./train -s 0 lr.train lr_model    
./predict lr.test lr_model test.out    
    
# by validation, we can get the two models of xgboost followed by the lr    
# finally, the prediction is got by the two catenated models, the leaf_mapping
can be got just like get_gbooster_out.py does      


# testing:    
    to be continued...
